# YoutubeMusicRevived - Work In Progress
This is a chrome extension to revive the amazing Music tab that was removed from YouTube
The extension is work in progress and not in chrome web store yet, but you can download it now and test it on your own (see [Usage](https://github.com/oronbz/YoutubeMusicRevived#usage))

# Usage
`git clone https://github.com/oronbz/YoutubeMusicRevived.git`

It’s really easy to test a new extension in Chrome. Type “chrome://extensions” in a tab to bring up the extensions page.

Once on this page, check “Developer mode” to enable loading unpacked extensions. This will allow you to load your extension from a folder. Finally, click “Load unpacked extension” or simply drag the “YoutubeMusicRevived” folder onto the page to load up the extension. That's it, next time you're on YouTube you should see the Music tab REVIVED!
